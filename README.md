# Laravel-Applcation-SMS-OTP-Integration
I completed this project in freelancer.com and received 5 reviews about this.
The primary goal of this project is to ensure the verification of users through a secure and reliable method via OTP code verification. 
So OTP code verification is necessary for protection of users. 
For this I created Vonage account and use PHP API because my main service project is developed by Laravel. 
Throught this course, I knew how to use various verification in Project authorization.
including -> Nodejs-Express and PHP and so on
If you use PHP case, you must define 'autoload'.
In conclusion, this helps in maintaining the quality of our user base as well as ensuring that users' accounts are secure from unauthorized access.

This project's main goal is to integrate SMS OTP integration for authentication and privacy security.
For this, we need to use Vinage account to implement Vinage API in this Business project.
In addition, for implementing this API, I need to make Interface and backend script.

This porject is updated using PHP - Vontage
